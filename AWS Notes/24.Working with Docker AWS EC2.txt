Docker
+++++++

-> Docker is a containerization tool

-> It is used to package our application & application dependencies 

-> Using Docker, we can easily run our application in multiple environments


++++++++Install Docker in Amazon Linux++++++++++++

$ sudo yum update -y
$ sudo yum install docker -y
$ sudo service docker start

# add user to docker group by executing below command
$ sudo usermod -aG docker ec2-user

$ docker info

#Restart the session
$ exit

Then press 'R' to restart the session (This is in MobaXterm)

++++++++++++++++++++Docker Commands+++++++++++++++++++

#see docker info 
$ docker info

# To see docker images execute below command
$ docker images

# Pulling hello-world docker image 
$ docker pull hello-world

# see docker image 
$ docker images

# Running hello-world docker image 
$ docker run hello-world

+++++++++++++++++++++++Working with Spring Boot Application Using Docker++++++++++++++++++++++++

# pulling docker image from docker hub
$ docker pull ashokit/spring-boot-rest-api

# Seee docker images after pulling
$ docker images

# Run docker image in detached mode
$ docker run -d -p 9090:9090 ashokit/spring-boot-rest-api

			Note: host-port:guest-port

Note: Allow Custom TCP Port with Range as 9090 for all traffic in EC2 Security Group

Working with AWS ECS Service
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

-> ECS stands for Elastic Container Service

-> Using ECS service we can run conatiners (Ex: Docker Container)


Steps to setup application using ECS service
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1) Take docker image name from docker hub

Image Name : ashokit/spring-boot-rest-api

2) Go to AWS ECS Service and click on 'Get Started' button

3) Click on 'Configure' button in 'Custom Card'

	Enter Container Name : ashokitcontainer
	Configure Docker Image Name : docker.io/ashokit/spring-boot-rest-api
	Configure Port Mapping as : 80

4) Go to Next Screen (Keep LBR as NONE)

5) Configure Your Cluster (Give some name for that)

6) Then Click on Create Cluster (it will complete 9 steps, we have to wait until 9 steps completed)

7) Go to security group of our ECS Cluster and configure application port number 9090 in Inbound Rules
	
Note: Our Docker image app having port as 9090

8) Click on View Service

9) Go to task tab (You can see task running)

10) Click on Task id , you can see public ip to access our application running in AWS ECS
