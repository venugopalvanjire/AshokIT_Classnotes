RDS (Relational Database Service)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

-> Every application will have 3 layers

			1) Front End (User interface)

			2) Back End (Business Logic)

			3) Database

-> End users will communicate with our application using frontend (user interface)

-> When end-user performs some operation in the front-end then it will send request to backend. Backend contains business logic

-> Backend logic will communicate with Database to perform DB operations

	(insert / update / retrieve / delete)


Challenges with Database Setup On our own
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1) Setup Machine to install Database Server
2) Purchase Database Server License
3) Install Database Server in our Machine
4) Setup Network for our machine
5) Setup power for machine
6) Setup a server room to keep our machines
7) Setup AC for room for cool temperature
8) Setup Security for room
9) Setup DB backups


-> If we use AWS cloud, then AWS will take care of all the above works which are required to setup Database for our application

-> In AWS we have RDS service to create and setup database required for our applications

-> We just need to pay the money and use Database using AWS RDS service. DB setup and maintenence will be taken care by AWS people.


*********Using RDS we can Easily set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud*******

Steps to test MYSQL DB Setup
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1) Download and install Visual Studio using below link

	Link : https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe

2) Download and install MySQL Workbench using below link

	Link : https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/

3) Create Database Connection in MySQL workbench using Database properties

4) Once we are able to connect with Database then we can execute below queries in Workbench

MySQL Queries
++++++++++++++

show databases;

use ihis;

show tables;

create table emp_dtls(emp_id integer(10), emp_name varchar(20), emp_salary integer(10));

insert into emp_dtls values(101, 'Raju', 5000);

insert into emp_dtls values(102, 'Rani', 6000);

select * from emp_dtls;
