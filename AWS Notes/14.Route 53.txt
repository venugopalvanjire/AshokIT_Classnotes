Steps to configure DNS name using Route 53 service
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Goto Route 53 service

2) Register Domain in AWS

Note: Based on domain extension charges will be applied

			.com ===> 12 $

			.link ===> 5 $

3) Go to billing dashboard and complete payment for the domain you have purchased

Note: When we purchase domain we will get one hosted zone with Name servers by default

Note: Domain Name also will get Name Servers by default

Note: "Domain Name" Name Servers and "Hosted Zone" Name Servers should be same

Note: Name servers are used to route the traffic to Domain Name

4) Go to hosted zone and create a new record

			Record Name : Leave it blank

			Record Type : keep it default value (A - Route to ipv4 or Aws resources)

			Value : Select Alias
					Choose Endpoint as "Alias to s3 website endpoint"
					Choose S3 Bucket Region
					Choose S3 Endpoint
					Click on Create Records

Note: Domain Name and S3 Bucket Name should be same

Note: We can route the traffic to Specific IP / Load Balancer URL / S3 Endpoint etc..

Note: Here i am using S3 Endpoint URL to route the traffic

5) Once Record is created wait for sometime (2 to 3 mins)
	
6) Access Domain Name URL in browser  (www.ashokit.org)
